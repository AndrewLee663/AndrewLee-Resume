        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a first year student of University of California, Riverside. I have been working part time as a server since the beginning of this June. I started working a week after I graduated from high school to make money for college tuition. My parents said they could pay for my tuition, but since Iâ€™ve become an adult, I wanted to make money myself and help my family financially, whether itâ€™s my tuition or spending money for my parents. I think it is meaningful because I got to give presents to my parents and my siblings for special days, being thankful for everything theyâ€™ve done for me. I am majoring in Media, which is about public relations, such as marketing through social media. The reason why I wanted to major in media is because the world has become so easier to get information through social media than television and news. People often learn about social issues from social media and get information from social media. Therefore, I thought it is a great opportunity to use social media as a marketing place, which will be easily and more exposed to people all around the world. I always had a big interest in marketing. I think marketing is one of the most important factors for selling a product because you have to let everyone know about the product and be able to explain how good our product is. <br><br>

        Social media is a very strong factor in this world now. When social media was not as active as today, people had to sit in front of their television or read newspapers to get information. Now, all they need to do is turn on their phone and click any platform they use to get information. The difficulties to gain people's attention is extremely easy with social media. For example, the war in Ukraine and Russia was the biggest issue of a war than any other war because it was broadcasted "live" all around the world. Same thing is happening in Israel and Palestine. I just thought that social media will always remain as the biggest market until the internet disappears. I donâ€™t think it will get smaller but only get bigger and bigger as social media and internet networks develop over time. As you can see, most people today use smartphones with access to internet, which will expose them more on social media and they could possibly see some of my posts on social media and get involved with my product.<br><br>

        However, what I've learned while learning about media is to catch people's attention easier. People nowadays don't prefer watching long videos that go over a minute. It's because of tiktok, reels, and youtube shorts. People now only desire the video that is short and irritating. I learned that we can make a short video showing the benefits and a good result of usage of the product we're selling in a short video and make people more curious and want to buy our product.
